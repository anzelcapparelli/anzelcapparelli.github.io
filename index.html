                    I graduated from UC Santa Barbara with a bachelors degree in Biology late 2018, but did not truly
                    know where to go from there, and lacked the practical experience necessary to get started in the
                    field. After a year of interning at UCSD Moore's Cancer Center, I began to further explore
                    other interests that had piqued in my undergraduate classes, in hopes of finding something I was
                    passionate about.

                    Coding is a skill that combines my passion for mathematics and my systematic approach to learning.
                    With coding, I find that my natural tendencies to focus on all details thrives, as the demanding
                    nature of coding syntax and the completeness of instructions needed to perform tasks both require
                    this trait. Add in the satisfaction of getting a file to work as intended and the appeal of making
                    apps on the web, where they can be widely used, viewed, and appreciated, and my desire to be a web
                    designer, although new, has been the strongest motivation that I have had in half a decade. I know
                    I'm up against those who have more coding experience than me, but I have the courage to go for it
                    anyways. After all, everyone had to start somewhere, and my dedication to keep learning and to grow
                    in areas other than strictly coding will lead me into becoming what I believe will be a succesfully
                    web developer.
